#### These are some scripts I made for personal use

##### Not my fault if they break your machine <3

* If there is a problem or they don't in a specific system, open an issue. I have lots of issues already so don't feel bad about it. I've tested them as much as I can.

* If you want to add a new script or improve an existing one open a pull request!
